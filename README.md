# ShadowzOfTheDark-Programs
My programs for the 1.12.2 Minecraft mod OpenComputers. Installable via oppm.

Install OpenOS and OPPM onto your computer and then run the following command to add this repo:
`oppm register ShadowzOfTheDark/ShadowzOfTheDark-Programs`

If that doesn't answer your question refer to the OC wiki. https://ocdoc.cil.li/tutorial:program:oppm
